            <p>If you’re anything like me you probably love to talk about the tools that you use to do your work every day. This page serves as a living document of the things I use every day.</p>

<h2 id="desktop-apps">Desktop apps</h2>

<p>I use a lot of apps throughout the day but these are the ones I use the most.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.iterm2.com/">iTerm2</a>: I work in the terminal 80% of the time, why not pick the best terminal app?</li>
  <li><a href="https://vim.sourceforge.io">Vim</a>: I recently (finally!) switched to Vim fulltime. My <a href="https://github.com/mijndert/.vim">.vimrc</a> is public.</li>
  <li><a href="https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/">Tweetbot</a>: not sure if it’s still the best Twitter desktop client, but it’s what I’m used to and it syncs nicely with my iOS devices.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.imore.com/reminders">Reminders</a>: it’s free, it makes lists, that’s all I ask from it.</li>
  <li><a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a>: 1Password really is a life saver. I couldn’t possibly live without it.</li>
  <li><a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a>: work related stuff goes here.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.codeux.com/textual/">Textual</a>: the best looking IRC client for Mac at the moment.</li>
  <li><a href="https://stuntsoftware.com/reflex/">Reflex</a>: prevents macOS from hijacking the media keys.</li>
  <li><a href="https://getdropsha.re/">Dropshare</a>: I use this constantly to share files with people.</li>
  <li><a href="https://macdown.uranusjr.com/">MacDown</a>: I’m a heavy user of MarkDown and the split view feature is a life saver.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="mobile-apps">Mobile apps</h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/spotify-music/id324684580?mt=8">Spotify</a>: this is my only source of music in the car and in the office, I can’t stand listening to the radio.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.flitsmeister.nl/">Flitsmeister</a>: realtime traffic information and warnings about speed traps. If you’re as much on the road as I am this is a no-brainer to have installed.</li>
  <li><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/instagram/id389801252?mt=8">Instagram</a>: I love taking pictures, but not as much as looking at them.</li>
  <li><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/overcast/id888422857?mt=8">Overcast</a>: to kill time in the car I listen to podcasts all the time.</li>
  <li><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-photos/id962194608?mt=8">Google Photos</a>: automatically creates a backup of my photos and reminds me of cool stuff that happened years ago.</li>
  <li><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/authy/id494168017?mt=8">Authy</a>: Authy stores my MFA keys so that I don’t have to carry a bunch of physical ones.</li>
  <li><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/apollo-for-reddit/id979274575?mt=8">Apollo</a>: the best Reddit app at this moment, with a nice native looking design.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.mutterirc.com/">Mutter</a>: for IRC on the go, works well with my <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/mijndert/znc-docker/">IRC bouncer</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="https://panic.com/prompt/">Prompt</a>: for accessing my servers while I’m away, in case of emergency.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>

<p>In terms of hardware I try to maintain a fairly simple setup. I don’t have too much stuff because otherwise everything gets outdated really quickly.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/specs-2015/">MacBook Pro 15” (2015)</a>: this is a laptop from work. It has an Intel i7, 16GB of RAM and a dedicated graphics card and that’s more power than I’ll ever need. It’s like having a very thin, good looking, supercomputer that I can carry with me.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-7">iPhone 7 128GB</a>: this is the best phone I’ve ever had. The matte black finish is gorgeous and I never run out of space.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MLA02LL/A/magic-mouse-2">Magic Mouse 2</a>: it’s not the best mouse in terms of ergonomics but it’s easy to carry around. I switch from the trackpad to the Magic Mouse regularly in order to prevent RSI.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.apple.com/nl/shop/product/MLA22N/A/magic-keyboard-nederlands">Magic Keyboard</a>: this might be controversial but I honestly think this is the greatest keyboard ever produced.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MMEF2AM/A/airpods">AirPods</a>: I never knew I needed AirPods until I actually bought them. They are truly magical in that they sound nice, the user experience is awesome, and they aren’t as ugly as I thought they would. AirPods feel like they shouldn’t exist but they do.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-watch-series-3/">Apple Watch Series 3</a>: this is another one of those “I didn’t know I needed it until I tried” products. My Apple Watch is now an important part of my life, keeping me healthy by daily reminders to stand/walk more and drink more water.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.apple.com/nl/ipad-pro/">9.7” iPad Pro</a>: when I get home I toss my iPhone to the side and switch to the iPad. I love its true-tone display.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="other">Other</h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.thenorthface.nl/shop/nl/tnf-nl/vault-rugzak-chj0">The North Face Vault backpack</a>: I recently got this backpack as my daily driver for work and leisure. It’s comfortable, has a lot of space and looks good too.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/switch/">Nintendo Switch</a>: This is not work related but it keeps me sane throughout the weeks. I love playing Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Splatoon 2, and Mario+Rabbids: Kingdom Battle. It’s by far my favourite console of all time mostly because I can take it anywhere. My PlayStation 4 has been collecting dust ever since I got myself a Switch.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.sonos.com/nl-nl/shop/beam.html">Sonos Beam</a>: my first Sonos and definitely not my last.</li>
</ul>
