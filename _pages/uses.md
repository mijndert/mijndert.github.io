If you're anything like me you probably love to talk about the tools that you use to do your work every day. This page serves as a living document of the things I use every day.

## Desktop apps

I use a lot of apps throughout the day but these are the ones I use the most.

* [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/): I work in the terminal 80% of the time, why not pick the best terminal app?
* [Vim](https://vim.sourceforge.io): I recently (finally!) switched to Vim fulltime. My [.vimrc](https://github.com/mijndert/.vim) is public.
* [Tweetbot](https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/): not sure if it's still the best Twitter desktop client, but it's what I'm used to and it syncs nicely with my iOS devices.
* [Reminders](https://www.imore.com/reminders): it's free, it makes lists, that's all I ask from it.
* [1Password](https://1password.com/): 1Password really is a life saver. I couldn't possibly live without it.
* [Slack](https://slack.com/): work related stuff goes here.
* [Textual](https://www.codeux.com/textual/): the best looking IRC client for Mac at the moment.
* [Reflex](https://stuntsoftware.com/reflex/): prevents macOS from hijacking the media keys.
* [Dropshare](https://getdropsha.re/): I use this constantly to share files with people.
* [MacDown](https://macdown.uranusjr.com/): I'm a heavy user of MarkDown and the split view feature is a life saver.

## Mobile apps

* [Spotify](https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/spotify-music/id324684580?mt=8): this is my only source of music in the car and in the office, I can't stand listening to the radio.
* [Flitsmeister](https://www.flitsmeister.nl/): realtime traffic information and warnings about speed traps. If you're as much on the road as I am this is a no-brainer to have installed.
* [Instagram](https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/instagram/id389801252?mt=8): I love taking pictures, but not as much as looking at them.
* [Overcast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/overcast/id888422857?mt=8): to kill time in the car I listen to podcasts all the time.
* [Google Photos](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-photos/id962194608?mt=8): automatically creates a backup of my photos and reminds me of cool stuff that happened years ago.
* [Authy](https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/authy/id494168017?mt=8): Authy stores my MFA keys so that I don't have to carry a bunch of physical ones.
* [Apollo](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/apollo-for-reddit/id979274575?mt=8): the best Reddit app at this moment, with a nice native looking design.
* [Mutter](https://www.mutterirc.com/): for IRC on the go, works well with my [IRC bouncer](https://hub.docker.com/r/mijndert/znc-docker/).
* [Prompt](https://panic.com/prompt/): for accessing my servers while I'm away, in case of emergency.

## Hardware

In terms of hardware I try to maintain a fairly simple setup. I don't have too much stuff because otherwise everything gets outdated really quickly.

* [MacBook Pro 15" (2015)](https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/specs-2015/): this is a laptop from work. It has an Intel i7, 16GB of RAM and a dedicated graphics card and that's more power than I'll ever need. It's like having a very thin, good looking, supercomputer that I can carry with me.
* [iPhone 7 128GB](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-7): this is the best phone I've ever had. The matte black finish is gorgeous and I never run out of space.
* [Magic Mouse 2](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MLA02LL/A/magic-mouse-2): it's not the best mouse in terms of ergonomics but it's easy to carry around. I switch from the trackpad to the Magic Mouse regularly in order to prevent RSI.
* [Magic Keyboard](https://www.apple.com/nl/shop/product/MLA22N/A/magic-keyboard-nederlands): this might be controversial but I honestly think this is the greatest keyboard ever produced.
* [AirPods](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MMEF2AM/A/airpods): I never knew I needed AirPods until I actually bought them. They are truly magical in that they sound nice, the user experience is awesome, and they aren't as ugly as I thought they would. AirPods feel like they shouldn't exist but they do.
* [Apple Watch Series 3](https://www.apple.com/apple-watch-series-3/): this is another one of those "I didn't know I needed it until I tried" products. My Apple Watch is now an important part of my life, keeping me healthy by daily reminders to stand/walk more and drink more water.
* [9.7" iPad Pro](https://www.apple.com/nl/ipad-pro/): when I get home I toss my iPhone to the side and switch to the iPad. I love its true-tone display.

## Other

* [The North Face Vault backpack](https://www.thenorthface.nl/shop/nl/tnf-nl/vault-rugzak-chj0): I recently got this backpack as my daily driver for work and leisure. It's comfortable, has a lot of space and looks good too.
* [Nintendo Switch](https://www.nintendo.com/switch/): This is not work related but it keeps me sane throughout the weeks. I love playing Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Splatoon 2, and Mario+Rabbids: Kingdom Battle. It's by far my favourite console of all time mostly because I can take it anywhere. My PlayStation 4 has been collecting dust ever since I got myself a Switch.
* [Sonos Beam](https://www.sonos.com/nl-nl/shop/beam.html): my first Sonos and definitely not my last.
