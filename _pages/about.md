I'm a 30-something total nerd from The Netherlands. I was compiling Linux at the age of 10 because I wanted to get XFree86 to run on my computer. It turned out the hardware wasn't even remotely compatible so that was the end of it. It didn't deter from me from trying even more daunting projects though. I believe those early experiments are what sparked my love for computers.

I started my career in IT by dropping out of school at the age of 22. At that age I already received the job offer of a lifetime. It was a kickstart for the rest of my life in IT. I worked at various digital agencies and hosting companies before landing a job as an AWS consultant. I've been working with AWS since 2011, back when load balancing was still a novelty on the platform.

My days now consist of helping companies move their existing infrastructure to AWS - every day brings something new to the table.

## Contact

Due to my busy schedule I prefer asynchronous communication. Either send me an e-mail (mijndert @ this domain) or find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mijndert). I hate calling.
